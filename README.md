## Hi there, I'm Jack 👋

I am an experienced Android developer with 2.5 years of experience in the TV industry, currently working with Sky Ltd. 

My industry experience involves enterprise Kotlin and Java applications, AI integration and telemetry for millions of customers. In my spare time, I love making Kotlin multiplatform applications and tinkering with small neural networks, if I'm not trying to climb a mountain or painting said mountain.
